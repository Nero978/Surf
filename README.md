## Let's Surf !

This game was rewritten by Chris Liu using C++ for CPP class 2023, and is only used for non commercial purposes.

If there are any bugs with it, please give me feedback to help me finish this homework. Thank you!

The idea of the game and some image materials come from Microsoft Edge. Please do not use them for business without Microsoft's permission.
